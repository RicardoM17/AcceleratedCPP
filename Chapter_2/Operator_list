x.y
The member y of object x
x[y]
The element in object x indexed by y
x++
Increments x , returning the original value of x
x--
Decrements x , returning the original value of x


++x
Increments x , returning the incremented value
--x
Decrements x , returning the decremented value
!x
Logical negation. If x is true then !x is false .

x * y
Product of x and y
x / y
Quotient of x and y . If both operands are integers,
the implementation chooses whether to round toward zero or - 8
x % y
Remainder of x divided by y , equivalent to x - ((x / y) * y)

x + y
Sum of x and yx - y
Result of subtracting y from x

x >> y
For integral x and y, x shifted right by y bits; y must be non-negative.
If x is an istream , reads from x into y
x << y
For integral x and y, x shifted left by y bits; y must be non-negative.
If x is an ostream , writes y onto x .

x relop y
Relational operators yield a bool indicating the truth of the relation.
The operators ( <, >, <= , and >= ) have their obvious meanings.

x == y
Yields a bool indicating whether x equals y
x != y
Yields a bool indicating whether x is not equal to y

x && y
Yields a bool indicating whether both x and y are true .
Evaluates y only if x is true .
x || y
Yields a bool indicating whether either x or y is true .
Evaluates y only if x is false .
x = y
Assign the value of y to x , yielding x as its result.
x op= y
Compound assignment operators; equivalent to x = x op y ,
where op is an arithmetic or shift operator.

x ? y1 : y2
Yields y1 if x is true ; y2 otherwise.
Evaluates only one of y1 and y2 .
